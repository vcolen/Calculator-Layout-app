# Calculator Layout Boss Challenge


## Hey guys! This project was made to fixate the knowledge gained from the [Dice game app](https://github.com/vcolen/Dice-game-app), about Auto Layout.
## This is what I've learned in this lesson:
- How to add constraints and understanding how Auto Layout works.
- How to Pin and Align elements.
- How to create containers to configure advanced layouts.
- How to debug auto layout errors.
- Understanding what Xcode needs in order to correctly layout a design.
- How to use Stack Views to create complex interfaces.

## This is a project from the iOS development bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu :)
